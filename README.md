# Full Stack Web Development Projects

This repository contains three folders, each showcasing projects built using different technologies: HTML/CSS, HTML/CSS/JS, and HTML/Tailwind CSS. You can easily use the first and second folders as they are, but for the third folder that utilizes Tailwind CSS, follow the steps below to run the projects on your system.

## Folder 1: HTML and CSS Projects

This folder contains small and simple websites built using only HTML and CSS. These projects are designed to demonstrate foundational web development skills.

## Folder 2: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Projects

In this folder, you will find websites that are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects involve more interactivity and showcase front-end development skills.

## Folder 3: HTML and Tailwind CSS Projects

The third folder focuses on projects created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, and these projects demonstrate its usage alongside HTML.
